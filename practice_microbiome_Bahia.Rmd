#subsetting phyloseq objects
```{r, subsetting phyloseq objects}
#You many want to remove certain samples or OTUs from the analysis.  There are several ways to do this in Phyloseq, all require creating a new Phyloseq object.
#First example, subset to samples that match a string in a column of the sample data (i.e. the mapping file)
practice2017_rare_controls<-subset_samples(practice2017_rare, Disease_status=="control")
sample_data(practice2017_rare_controls)
#Second example, subset to samples that match everything except the string in a column of the sample data
practice2017_rare_disease<-subset_samples(practice2017_rare, Disease_status!="control")
#Now check the sample data for your new object to make sure it did what you think it did.  In this example I'm only returning the column that lists Disease_status
sample_data(practice2017_rare_disease)$Disease_status
#Third example, subset to samples that match several strings in a column of the sample data
practice2017_rare_disease2<-subset_samples(practice2017_rare, Disease_status%in%c("mdd", "recovering_mdd"))
#And check the sample data as before.
sample_data(practice2017_rare_disease2)$Disease_status
#Forth example, subset to samples that match everything except several strings in a column of the sample data
practice2017_rare_controls2<-subset_samples(practice2017_rare, !(Disease_status%in%c("mdd", "recovering_mdd")))
#And check the sample data as before.
sample_data(practice2017_rare_controls2)$Disease_status
```

#Alpha diversity analysis
```{r, alpha diversity}
#Once you have rarefied your data, explore the level of alpha diversity.  Uses phyloseq plot function which is built on ggplot2.  The x value will determine how samples are grouped along the x axis.
plot_richness(practice2017_rare, x="Disease_status", measures=c("Observed", "Chao1","Shannon"))+
  geom_boxplot()+xlab("Group")+ylab("Diversity")
#Convert alpha diversity estimates to a data form we can use for statistical testing
practice2017_rare_richness<-as.matrix(estimate_richness(practice2017_rare, measures=c("Observed","Chao1","Shannon")))
##don't need this - row names are correct
#row.names(practice2017_rare_richness)<-row.names(sample_data(practice2017_rare))
practice2017_rare_richness<-cbind(practice2017_rare_richness,sample_data(practice2017_rare))
practice2017_rare_richness
#For comaparisons of alpha diversity of more than two groups, use the Kruskal-Wallis test 
#Test if alpha diversity (observed) is significantly different between Disease_status groups
kruskal.test(Observed ~ Disease_status, data=practice2017_rare_richness)
##Kruskal-wallis rank sum test, pvalue 0.2284, thus no significant difference between populations, null hypothesis assumes from identical populations
#Now test if diversity is significantly different between controls and patients who were ever depressed (and recovering mdd groups (Original_status)
#only two groups here so use Man-Whitney U test
#wilcox.test(Observed ~ Disease_status, data=practice2017_rare_richness)
#null asserts that medians of two samples are indentical 

```
###UP TO HERE - DO EXAMINATION OF NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE CONTROLS


##THEN 
#cleaning and transformation 
```{r Data cleaning and transformation}
practice2017_rare_rel<-transform_sample_counts(practice2017_rare, function(x) x/sum(x))
#x is always the count of the OTU in transforming the OTU table functions

head(otu_table(practice2017_rare)) 
head(otu_table(practice2017_rare_rel)) 
#raw count changed to proportions (number between 0-1) from dividing by number of seqs in the sample (same number for all as we rarefy)

##filter, removing OTUs that are only there in a very low abundance
practice2017_rare_rel_fil1<-filter_taxa(practice2017_rare_rel, function(x) mean(x) > 1e-5, TRUE)
#on average for any OTU the mean count has to be greater than 1e-5 9(0.00005) equivalant to 0.0001% 

##summary of objects
(practice2017_rare_rel)
practice2017_rare_rel_fil1
##filtering has cut out a lot of the OTUs

```

## Including Plots
```{r Plotting}
#psmelt function combines everything in a really long scary way that is how ggplot likes to view the data, long format. 
practice_smelt<-psmelt(practice2017_rare_rel_fil1)
head(practice_smelt)

#dplyr used to manipulate data, to get the information that we want for ggplot 

ggplot(practice_smelt, aes(x=Sample, y=Abundance, fill=Phylum))+geom_bar(stat="identity")
#fill is colour, stat="identity" uses the actual number in the plot and doesnt do anything to it  

ggplot(practice_smelt, aes(x=Sample, y=Abundance, fill=Phylum))+geom_bar(stat="identity")+facet_grid(.~Disease_status)


ggplot(practice_smelt, aes(x=Sample, y=Abundance, fill=Phylum))+geom_bar(stat="identity")+facet_grid(.~Disease_status, scales="free")
#splits up the data in the plot into separate subplots, add in as formula
#scale=free makes it proper 

phyla_plot<-practice_smelt %>% group_by(Disease_status, Phylum) %>% mutate(av_abund=mean(Abundance)) %>% distinct(Abundance, .keep_all=TRUE)

head(phyla_plot)



```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
